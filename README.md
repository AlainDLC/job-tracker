# Job Application Tracker

The **Job Application Tracker** is a web app designed to help job seekers efficiently manage and track their job applications. Users can enter job details (company name, job title, application date, CV used), track progress through a drag-and-drop process tracker, and view all applications in a table format. The app also includes a calendar for tracking application dates and a CV upload feature.

## Key Features:

- Job application form for entering details
- Drag-and-drop progress tracker for stages like "Applied," "Interview," and "Offer"
- Calendar to track application dates
